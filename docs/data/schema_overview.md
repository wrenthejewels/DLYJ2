# Schema Overview

## Directory model

- `data/raw/`: external source mirrors or reduced extracts.
- `data/normalized/`: model-facing CSVs joined by canonical IDs.
- `data/crosswalks/`: mappings across occupation taxonomies.
- `data/metadata/`: provenance and normalization policy.

## Canonical keys

- `occupation_id`: stable internal occupation key
- `task_id`: stable internal task key
- `onet_soc_code`: canonical external occupation code for US-first launch
- `task_cluster_id`: stable reduced-task taxonomy key
- `source_id`: provenance key from `source_registry.yaml`

33. `occupation_role_variants.csv` (live reviewed role-variant baselines for occupations that now support more than one stable role shape in the browser scorer)

## Purpose of the normalized layer

This layer is designed so the live v2.x model can answer:
- what tasks are exposed
- which tasks define the role's value
- which tasks carry bargaining power
- which supporting tasks are indirectly at risk because they depend on exposed core work
- whether exposed tasks are more likely augmented or automated
- whether exposed tasks decouple cleanly from the residual role
- how viable the residual role remains
- how adaptable the worker is relative to transformed role states

Current live scoring note:
- `task_augmentation_automation_priors.csv` and `occupation_exposure_priors.csv` still provide the fallback baseline difficulty anchor in the browser scorer
- `task_source_evidence.csv` is now the runtime task-evidence resolver layer: it promotes live task evidence, reviewed task estimates, and benchmark task labels ahead of proxy fallback
- clusters with strong enough resolved task-evidence coverage can now shift their baseline difficulty toward task evidence before that baseline is projected onto task rows
- high-reliability task rows can now promote further into a task-first task baseline before residual evidence blending
- `task_exposure_evidence.csv` now primarily feeds the `live_task_evidence` tier inside that resolver and preserves Anthropic-specific observation metadata such as usage share
- task-level evidence rows continue to feed evidence confidence and `direct_coverage_ratio` even when they do not clear that threshold
- task-derived cluster summaries now drive the public cluster layer and the live wave trajectory
- `occupation_role_variants.csv` is now a runtime input for a small reviewed subset of heterogeneous occupations; it does not score anything by itself, but it changes which default task/function baseline the model starts from before user edits
- the stronger reviewed split occupations can now differ at the function-anchor layer too, not only by task bundle
- accounting now follows that stronger split pattern too: the reviewed accounting variants now diverge through an explicit audit-assurance anchor rather than only through task bundle choice
- reviewed supplemental anchors are now slightly broader than the explicit role-variant subset; some occupations, such as `Financial and Investment Analysts`, `Software Developers`, `Graphic Designers`, `Paralegals and Legal Assistants`, `Compliance Officers`, `Training and Development Specialists`, and `Mechanical Engineers`, can now expose more than one reviewed default function anchor even without a separate variant selector
- software development, graphic design, paralegal support, compliance work, training-content work, and mechanical engineering now follow that structural-anchor path too: each occupation carries a richer reviewed default function graph without exposing explicit runtime variants
- journalism now follows that stronger split pattern as well: the anchor/producer baseline activates a reviewed broadcast-orchestration anchor instead of reusing the reporter-side source-development anchor
- technical writing now follows it more closely too: the release-enablement baseline carries the release-planning task and more clearly weighted workflow/review edges into the release-enablement anchor
- editing now follows it more closely too: the managing-editor baseline carries a more orchestration-heavy task bundle and more clearly weighted planning/packaging edges into the publication-orchestration anchor
- management-analyst consulting now follows it more closely too: the change-enablement baseline carries the worker-training rollout task and more clearly weighted rollout/governance edges into the change-enablement anchor
- web-development now follows it too: the platform-maintainer baseline carries deployment, reliability, accessibility, and performance work into a reviewed web-platform-enablement anchor instead of staying inside one flat software-delivery baseline
- `occupation_structural_calibration_targets.csv` is not a runtime input; it exists only for calibration, disagreement reporting, and tuning review
- `occupation_ors_structural_context.csv` is also not a runtime input; it currently feeds the calibration layer’s human-guardrail target using ORS autonomy, supervision, and pace-control structure
- `occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv` is also not a runtime input; it currently feeds the calibration layer’s role-heterogeneity target using ACS wage dispersion, education dispersion, industry dispersion, and worker-mix spread
- `occupation_industry_mix.csv` is also not a runtime input; it remains a general ACS occupation-by-industry context table
- `occupation_btos_sector_mix.csv` is also not a runtime input; it currently bridges ACS occupation sector mix into the BTOS adoption-context calibration layer
- `industry_ai_adoption_context.csv` is also not a runtime input; it currently feeds the calibration layer’s adoption-context target using BTOS sector AI-use and deployment-change estimates
- `occupation_role_shape_review.csv` is also not a runtime input; it currently turns the ACS/structural heterogeneity queue into a concrete candidate list for future variant review and expansion work
