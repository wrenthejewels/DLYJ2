# Structural Calibration Report

This report is the first empirical calibration scaffold for the live model.

It does not validate AI-driven job loss directly.
It checks whether the model’s structural claims line up directionally with the best local non-runtime context currently present in the repo.

Generated from:
- `data/normalized/occupation_ors_structural_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/industry_ai_adoption_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_btos_sector_mix.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_quality_indicators.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_labor_market_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_adaptation_priors.csv`
- live outputs from `v2_engine.js`

Current limitations:
- `occupation_ors_structural_context.csv` is now the main structural input for the human-guardrail check, using the normalized ORS structural index.
- occupations without usable ORS structural rows are currently left unscored for that strongest check instead of being silently folded back into a weaker proxy.
- `occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv` is calibration-only context. It is useful for checking whether the model is overstating role uniformity, but it is still an external structural proxy rather than a runtime role-definition input.
- the heterogeneity check is not raw ACS alone; the target is scaled into a fragmentation-pressure range and conditioned on lower people-intensity so it stays closer to the model’s actual role-splitting claim.
- `industry_ai_adoption_context.csv` is also calibration-only context. It measures observed sector AI use and deployment change, not direct task automability.
- the BTOS adoption check is not compared on raw business-use percentages; the BTOS signal is mapped into the model’s organizational-conversion range so it behaves as a directional review target rather than a literal prevalence label.
- labor-market checks are contextual and should not be treated as proof of AI displacement or demand expansion.
- this report is for calibration and review, not runtime scoring.

## Interpretation

- Treat `Human Guardrail Plausibility` as the most useful current structural check.
- Treat `Adoption Context Plausibility` as the best current outer-layer check on whether the model is over- or under-stating organizational AI conversion relative to observed sector uptake.
- Treat `Role Heterogeneity Plausibility` as the best current check on whether the model is making an occupation look too uniform or too split.
- Treat `Demand Context Plausibility` and `Wage Leverage Plausibility` as weak calibration layers that can surface suspicious outliers, not as truth labels.
- Occupations with repeated high-priority gaps should be reviewed at the layer that likely caused the disagreement: function anchors, accountability weights, task evidence coverage, or role-shape assumptions.

## Next Data Upgrades

- Extend ORS coverage or mapping so fewer launch occupations remain unscored on the strongest human-guardrail check.
- Use the new BTOS review queue to decide whether adoption-realization tuning should remain calibration-only or graduate into a later controlled runtime parameter review.
- Refresh `O*NET` after the current official calibration layers are stable, so structural tuning is not confounded with a database-version jump.
- Consider whether the ACS heterogeneity layer is strong enough to justify future multi-variant occupation modeling rather than one default role shape per occupation.
