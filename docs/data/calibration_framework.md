# Calibration Framework

## Scope

This document is the canonical reference for the empirical calibration layer.

It does not define the live runtime score.

It defines how external or non-runtime data should be used to check, pressure-test, and tune the live model.

## Why This Layer Exists

The live model makes forward-looking claims about role transformation.

Those claims should not be "validated" directly against current job loss or raw employment changes because those outcomes are heavily confounded by:
- macroeconomic cycles
- industry-specific demand
- hiring freezes
- firm strategy
- measurement lag
- non-AI productivity changes

So the calibration layer is aimed at structural plausibility, not direct labor-displacement proof.

## Current Principle

Use external or non-runtime data in three ways:

1. structural calibration
   - checks whether the model's retained-human and role-shape logic is directionally plausible
2. contextual calibration
   - checks whether demand and labor-market context strongly disagree with the model
3. review prioritization
   - identifies occupations where the model likely needs manual review or data upgrades

Do not use this layer to directly drive runtime task scores unless a source is later promoted into the live scoring stack.

## Current Calibration Checks

### 1. Human Guardrail Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model's retained human/accountability layer is directionally plausible

Current target:
- `human_constraint_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_ors_structural_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_quality_indicators.csv` (confidence supplement only)

Current formula:
- ORS signal:
  - `human_constraint_index` from `occupation_ors_structural_context.csv`
  - that normalized index is itself derived from:
    - `0.40 * autonomy_intensity`
    - `0.30 * supervising_others_share`
    - `0.20 * inverse_pace_constraint_intensity`
    - `0.10 * pause_control_share`
- target when ORS exists:
  - `ors_human_constraint_signal`
- when ORS is missing:
  - the occupation is currently left unscored for this strongest check rather than being collapsed back into a weaker proxy target

Compared against:
- `0.60 * retained_accountability_strength`
- `0.40 * retained_function_strength`

Current strength:
- strong

Reason:
- ORS is now the main structural check for this layer and is materially better grounded than the old quality-only proxy, but some launch occupations still lack usable ORS rows and are therefore left unscored until coverage improves

### 2. Demand Context Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model's demand-expansion layer looks directionally implausible relative to current labor-market context

Current target:
- `demand_context_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_labor_market_context.csv`

Current formula:
- `0.55 * projection_growth_percentile`
- `0.25 * openings_rate_percentile`
- `0.20 * inverse_unemployment_percentile`

Compared against:
- `demand_expansion_signal`

Current strength:
- weak

Reason:
- these are context variables, not causal evidence of AI-driven demand effects

### 3. Wage Leverage Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model's retained bargaining-power layer is obviously out of line with broad wage context

Current target:
- `wage_leverage_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_labor_market_context.csv`

Current formula:
- `0.75 * median_wage_percentile`
- `0.25 * wage_dispersion_percentile`

Compared against:
- `retained_bargaining_power`

Current strength:
- weak

Reason:
- wage level is only a coarse proxy for bargaining power and should never be treated as direct proof

### 4. Routine Pressure Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model's pressure and compressibility layers are directionally plausible relative to routine share and occupational complexity

Current target:
- `routine_pressure_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_adaptation_priors.csv`

Current formula:
- `0.55 * routine_share`
- `0.20 * inverse_job_zone`
- `0.15 * inverse_people_share`
- `0.10 * inverse_learning_intensity`

Compared against:
- `0.60 * direct_exposure_pressure`
- `0.40 * workflow_compression`

Current strength:
- medium

Reason:
- this is still a derived target, but it is much closer to the model's structural claim about routine/compressible work than labor-market outcome proxies

### 5. Specialization Resilience Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model's retained-function and retained-bargaining layers are directionally plausible relative to occupational complexity and knowledge intensity

Current target:
- `specialization_resilience_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_adaptation_priors.csv`

Current formula:
- `0.30 * adaptive_capacity_score`
- `0.25 * learning_intensity_score`
- `0.20 * transferability_score`
- `0.10 * normalized_job_zone`
- `0.15 * knowledge_share`

Compared against:
- `0.45 * retained_function_strength`
- `0.35 * retained_bargaining_power`
- `0.20 * function_retention`

Current strength:
- medium

Reason:
- this is not a pure external benchmark, but it is structurally closer to retained-role resilience than wage level alone

### 6. Role Heterogeneity Plausibility

Purpose:
- check whether the model is making an occupation look too uniform or too split relative to observed within-occupation heterogeneity

Current target:
- `role_heterogeneity_target`

Current data:
- `data/normalized/occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_adaptation_priors.csv`

Current formula:
- ACS heterogeneity signal:
  - `0.35 * industry_dispersion`
  - `0.25 * education_dispersion`
  - `0.20 * worker_mix_dispersion`
  - `0.20 * wage_dispersion_percentile`
- fragmentation-pressure blend:
  - `0.60 * acs_heterogeneity_signal`
  - `0.40 * inverse_people_share`
- scaled target:
  - `0.05 + 0.40 * fragmentation_pressure_blend`

Compared against:
- `role_fragmentation_risk`

Current strength:
- medium

Reason:
- ACS PUMS gives a real external read on within-occupation spread, but heterogeneity is still not identical to fragmentation, so the current target is deliberately scaled into a lower fragmentation-pressure range and conditioned on people intensity rather than treated as a one-to-one truth label

Current review conclusion:
- the strongest current multi-variant candidates are content and analysis-heavy occupations where the work bundle is structurally diverse without being primarily people-intense
- the current shortlist is:
  - `Editors`
  - `News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists`
  - `Management Analysts`
  - `Technical Writers`
  - `Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists`
- watchlist rather than immediate split candidates:
  - `Web Developers`
  - `Operations Research Analysts`

## Current Outputs

The calibration scaffold currently writes:
- `data/normalized/occupation_ors_structural_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_industry_mix.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_btos_sector_mix.csv`
- `data/normalized/industry_ai_adoption_context.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_structural_calibration_targets.csv`
- `data/normalized/occupation_role_shape_review.csv`
- `docs/data/structural_calibration_report.md`
- `docs/data/role_shape_review.md`

Generated by:
- `scripts/data/normalize_ors.py`
- `scripts/data/normalize_acs_pums.py`
- `scripts/data/normalize_btos.py`
- `scripts/data/run_structural_calibration_report.js`
- `scripts/data/run_role_shape_review.js`

The generated target table now also includes:
- `highest_review_tier`
- `primary_review_layer`
- `primary_review_strength`
- `primary_review_score`
- `primary_review_reason`

Those fields are not runtime inputs.
They exist so calibration disagreements can be routed to the right tuning layer instead of being handled as generic "the model seems off" feedback.

The generated markdown report also summarizes which review layers recur most often across occupations so recurring tuning problems are easy to spot.
It now also separates the strongest medium-strength structural queue from weaker contextual queues so review effort is not dominated by the noisiest proxy.
The role-shape review pass now also converts the heterogeneity queue into an explicit candidate list for future multi-variant occupation modeling, so that review no longer depends on ad hoc session notes.

This layer has already informed one runtime tuning pass:
- repeated bargaining-power mismatches in routine and support-heavy roles led to a recalibration of the live `retained_bargaining_power` formula
- the calibration data still stays outside runtime; it was used to diagnose the layer, not piped in as a direct score input

It has now informed a second runtime tuning pass:
- once the queue became strength-aware, routine/admin-heavy occupations surfaced as the strongest medium-strength structural mismatch
- that led to a recalibration of routine-task reachability and workflow compression using the existing adaptation layer's routine context

## How To Use This Layer

1. run the calibration report
2. inspect rank correlations and largest disagreements
3. use the generated review-layer recommendation to decide which model layer to inspect first
4. review occupations with repeated high-priority mismatches
5. tune the layer that likely caused the mismatch

Likely tuning layers:
- function anchors
- accountability guardrails
- task evidence coverage
- task-to-function weights
- role-shape assumptions

Do not jump straight to changing top-level labels without finding the causal layer underneath.

## What Is Not Yet Honest To Claim

Do not claim that this framework currently validates:
- direct AI-caused headcount reduction
- realized AI displacement by occupation
- net demand effects from AI
- exact future role collapse timing

That is outside the scope of the current empirical layer.

## Best Next Data Upgrades

Priority upgrades:
- controlled `O*NET 30.2` refresh after the current official calibration layers are stable

Implemented official calibration layer:
- `BLS ORS` is now integrated as `occupation_ors_structural_context.csv`
- current ORS-derived fields emphasize autonomy, supervisory responsibility, and pace-control structure because those aligned most cleanly with the model’s retained-accountability claim
- ORS still remains calibration-only; it does not directly change runtime task scores
- `ACS PUMS` is now integrated as `occupation_heterogeneity_context.csv`
- current ACS-derived fields emphasize within-occupation wage dispersion, education dispersion, industry dispersion, and worker-mix spread
- the live heterogeneity check scales that ACS signal into a lower fragmentation-pressure target and conditions it on lower people intensity before comparing it to `role_fragmentation_risk`
- ACS still remains calibration-only; it does not directly change runtime task scores
- `occupation_industry_mix.csv` remains as the broader ACS occupation-by-industry context table
- `occupation_btos_sector_mix.csv` is now emitted from the same ACS pass as the direct bridge into BTOS sector context
- `BTOS` is now integrated as `industry_ai_adoption_context.csv`
- current BTOS-derived fields emphasize current AI use, planned AI use, task-substitution intensity, workflow-change intensity, and LLM use at the sector layer
- the live adoption check maps that BTOS signal into the model’s organizational-conversion range before comparing it to the model’s adoption-realization surface
- BTOS still remains calibration-only; it does not directly change runtime task scores

Until the next calibration layers are integrated, the current calibration layer should be treated as:
- useful
- honest
- partial

not:
- definitive
- outcome-validating
- final

## Next Official Integrations

Autoresearch status checked on `2026-03-13`:
- `BLS ORS` official public-use data is now integrated through a `2025` preliminary release with `2023` backstop coverage for the launch occupation set.
- `ACS PUMS` official `2024 ACS 1-year` microdata is now integrated through the Census API for the launch occupation set.
- `BTOS` official AI/business-condition context is now integrated as a calibration-only adoption-context layer joined through ACS sector mix.
- `O*NET` has moved beyond the repo's current `30.1` footing, but that should be handled as a separate controlled refresh after the next calibration layers are in place.

Recommended build order:
1. review the new `role_shape_review.md` output and decide whether the strongest candidates warrant explicit multi-variant modeling
2. review the `BTOS` adoption queue and decide whether any adoption-realization tuning is warranted
3. `O*NET 30.2` refresh after the stronger calibration layers are stable

Current BTOS normalized tables:
- `industry_ai_adoption_context.csv`
  - purpose: outer-layer calibration for adoption realization review
- `occupation_btos_sector_mix.csv`
  - purpose: ACS-derived occupation sector bridge for BTOS joins

Current role-shape review outputs:
- `occupation_role_shape_review.csv`
  - purpose: generated occupation-level candidate table for future multi-variant modeling
- `role_shape_review.md`
  - purpose: human-readable summary of strong candidates and watchlist occupations

Promotion rule:
- keep these outer-layer sources in calibration first
- do not promote them into runtime scoring until at least one full review cycle shows that they improve disagreement triage without collapsing interpretability
