# Role Transformation Contract

## Purpose

This document defines the first-pass normalized layer that sits above task exposure.

It makes the model answer not only:
- what tasks are exposed

But also:
- what function the role serves
- which tasks matter most to that function
- what accountability still stays with a human
- how likely the role is to compress, fragment, delegate, or retain its core

## New normalized files

### `job_description_task_evidence.csv`

Reviewed public-posting task-gap expansion layer.

Use it to:
- store non-O*NET task evidence for launch roles
- preserve provenance for manually reviewed task additions
- feed new tasks into the richer task inventory

Current coverage:
- all `34` modeled occupations now have reviewed posting-backed task-gap additions

### `task_source_evidence.csv`

Source-specific task evidence contract.

Each row preserves one task and one source view with:
- normalized exposure
- normalized augmentation
- normalized automation
- evidence weight
- confidence
- promotion status

Current source roles:
- `live_task_evidence`
- `reviewed_task_estimate`
- `benchmark_task_label`
- `cluster_prior_proxy`
- `fallback_task_proxy`

Current rule:
- cluster and fallback proxies remain visible, but they are now down-weighted when stronger task-level evidence already exists for the same task
- in the live browser scorer, `task_source_evidence.csv` is now the actual task-level resolver:
  - `live_task_evidence` has highest task-level priority
  - `reviewed_task_estimate` is next
  - `benchmark_task_label` is the last task-level promotion tier
  - `cluster_prior_proxy` and `fallback_task_proxy` remain fallback only
- once the resolved task-level evidence reliability clears the runtime threshold, the resolved task evidence can alter both task-level `automation_difficulty` and task-level `direct_exposure_pressure`
- clusters with strong enough resolved task-evidence coverage can also shift their baseline difficulty path toward task evidence before that baseline is projected onto task rows
- tasks with strong enough resolved task-level reliability can now promote into a task-first task baseline before any residual task-evidence blend is applied

### `occupation_source_priors.csv`

Source-specific occupation prior contract.

Use it to compare:
- live aggregate priors
- benchmark percentiles
- benchmark bundle summaries

This is the occupation-level comparison layer that keeps benchmarks visible without forcing them into the live task layer too early.

### `role_functions.csv`

Stores role summary and function anchors.

Current first pass:
- one primary function anchor for every launch occupation
- reviewed supplemental anchors for a targeted multi-anchor subset where one function anchor was too reductive
- role-family defaults for broad coverage
- occupation-specific overrides for function-sensitive roles
- `Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists` now includes a reviewed supplemental marketing-operations anchor so its execution-heavy variant is function-distinct as well as task-distinct
- `News Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists` now includes a reviewed broadcast-orchestration anchor so its anchor/producer variant is function-distinct from the field-reporter source-development path

### `occupation_function_map.csv`

Binds each occupation to its function anchors and stores a `delegability_guardrail`.

Interpretation:
- higher guardrail means exposed tasks are less likely to eliminate the role outright because judgment, trust, authority, or liability still matter

### `occupation_role_variants.csv`

Reviewed role-variant baseline contract for occupations that are too heterogeneous for one default bundle.

Each row stores:
- an occupation-scoped `variant_id`
- a reviewed `variant_label` and `variant_summary`
- explicit default `task_ids`
- explicit default `function_ids`
- preferred task-family and function signatures used for recommendation
- a questionnaire-signature sketch used to recommend the closest variant in the live app

Current live/browser status:
- this file is now a direct runtime input for a small reviewed subset of launch occupations
- it does not directly change task pressure formulas
- it changes which default task/function baseline the role studio starts from before user edits
- the browser can now recommend a reviewed variant from the current questionnaire profile and current role mix, while still allowing the user to override it explicitly
- for the stronger reviewed split occupations, variants can now differ at both the task-bundle layer and the function-anchor layer

### `task_function_edges.csv`

Maps every normalized task to one or more occupation function anchors.

Key fields:
- `task_to_function_weight`
- `accountability_weight`
- `judgment_requirement`
- `trust_requirement`
- `regulatory_liability_weight`
- `human_authority_requirement`

This is the bridge between flat task exposure and role-level function retention.

Current behavior:
- tasks can now bind to more than one function anchor where a reviewed split is warranted
- the live browser scorer now uses the reviewed baseline task-to-function edges directly, then lets user-declared task-to-function links override or add to that graph at runtime
- the scorer uses both the task-to-function edge weights and the occupation-level function weights when aggregating function pressure

### `function_accountability_profiles.csv`

Stores function-level accountability and institutional burden.

Use it to represent:
- who the role serves
- what the role is accountable for
- how much judgment, trust, liability, and authority remain human-owned

### `occupation_role_transformation.csv`

First-pass occupation-level audit/reference output from the broader transformation pipeline.

Current metrics:
- `direct_task_pressure`
- `indirect_dependency_pressure`
- `function_exposure_pressure`
- `retained_function_strength`
- `retained_accountability_strength`
- `retained_bargaining_power`
- `role_fragmentation_risk`
- `role_compressibility`
- `demand_expansion_signal`
- `delegation_likelihood`
- `headcount_displacement_risk`
- `role_transformation_type`

Current live/browser status:
- the browser scorer now computes the function-pressure and function-retention layer live from the active edited task/function graph
- this CSV remains useful as an offline audit, comparison, and validation layer, but it is no longer the source of truth for the live browser score

### `occupation_role_explanations.csv`

Derived explanation layer for each occupation-level transformation output.

Use it to surface:
- the strongest pressure signals
- the strongest retained counterweight
- the current function-anchor mix
- the current evidence mix
- which occupations should be reviewed next because proxy dependence is still high

Current live/browser status:
- the browser now generates explanation summaries from the current run instead of reading this CSV into the live scoring path
- this file remains an offline occupation-level audit summary for QA, comparison, and reviewed reference text

### `pilot_role_transformation_calibration.csv`

Stores reviewed occupation-level calibration adjustments for the reviewed set.

Use it to apply explicit, auditable changes where reviewed role logic still differs from first-pass outputs.

Current reviewed use:
- preserve stronger authority/accountability guardrails for lawyers
- promote data scientists toward augmented-core interpretation
- preserve recommendation/adoption value for management analysts
- increase recomposition pressure for technical writers
- preserve relationship and commitment work for sales representatives
- increase compression/displacement pressure for bookkeeping and clerical support roles
- preserve executive assistants as the higher-context admin contrast
- preserve project-management ownership, escalation handling, and client coordination
- preserve follow-through and judgment for broad business operations work
- increase compression pressure for customer support while keeping residual service ownership
- preserve more residual control value for accountants than for generic clerical finance support
- place paralegals under stronger recomposition pressure than attorney roles
- preserve trust, policy judgment, and manager coaching value in HR work
- preserve learning-program ownership while allowing stronger content-production recomposition
- increase direct tooling pressure for marketing analysis and marketing operations work
- preserve requirements and integration ownership for systems analysts
- preserve core engineering ownership for software developers despite higher exposure
- preserve operating ownership and resource decisions for operations managers
- preserve tradeoff judgment for finance-analysis work
- preserve decision interpretation in operations-research roles despite high modeling exposure
- preserve web-platform ownership while raising tooling pressure for web development work
- raise generation pressure for graphic-design execution while preserving brand direction
- raise generation pressure and recomposition for writers and authors
- preserve relationship and revenue ownership for advertising-oriented sales work
- preserve compliance authority, liability, and escalation ownership
- preserve supply coordination and tradeoff value in logistics work
- preserve technical ownership in electronics and mechanical engineering
- raise recomposition pressure for journalism while preserving reporting judgment
- preserve reputation and relationship coordination in public-relations work
- preserve editorial gatekeeping and quality-control value for editors
- increase compressibility pressure for statistical assistants relative to analyst roles

## Current scoring rule

The current stack now works like this:

1. Start with the richer task inventory.
2. For occupations with reviewed role variants, resolve the selected or recommended baseline variant from `occupation_role_variants.csv`.
3. Use that reviewed variant to choose the starting default task/function bundle before any user edits are applied.
4. Attach all available source-specific task evidence.
5. Compute baseline cluster automation difficulty from cluster priors shrunk toward the occupation exposure prior.
6. For clusters with strong enough resolved task-evidence coverage, shift that cluster baseline toward a task-first cluster evidence estimate.
7. Project the resulting cluster read onto active tasks as the fallback task-difficulty model.
8. Resolve each task's best available task-level evidence from `task_source_evidence.csv` using explicit source precedence.
9. For tasks with sufficiently reliable resolved task evidence, promote the task baseline itself toward task evidence.
10. For tasks with remaining reliable resolved task evidence, blend the resolved task evidence signal into final `automation_difficulty`.
11. Compute baseline task `direct_exposure_pressure` from that task-level difficulty and then blend the resolved task-pressure signal into final `direct_exposure_pressure` when reliability clears the same threshold.
12. Add indirect pressure through dependency edges.
13. Compute retained task share and retained leverage per task.
14. Aggregate the scored task rows back into task-derived cluster summaries.
15. Recompute cluster absorption, wave assignment, and the public wave engine from those task-derived cluster summaries.
16. Weight each task by how much it supports the role's function or functions.
17. Preserve human guardrails through accountability, trust, liability, and authority.
18. In the live browser scorer, compute function exposure, retained function strength, retained accountability, retained bargaining power, delegation pressure, and displacement pressure from the active edited run.
19. Produce role-transformation outputs instead of stopping at exposure.
20. In the offline audit layer, apply reviewed calibration overrides only where a manual review pass has explicitly justified them.

Current bargaining-power rule:
- `retained_bargaining_power` is no longer driven mainly by static task bargaining weights
- the live scorer now leans primarily on pressure-adjusted retained task leverage, then blends in function-level bargaining retention and guardrails
- support-heavy and routine-heavy work that is already under high pressure now pulls retained bargaining power down instead of being over-credited by raw task weights alone

Current routine-pressure rule:
- the live scorer now reads the adaptation layer's structural routine context more directly when estimating routine-task pressure and workflow compression
- occupations with high derived `routine_share`, low `people_share`, and lower job-zone complexity now get an extra routine-reachability lift, concentrated in `cluster_execution_routine`, `cluster_workflow_admin`, `cluster_documentation`, and secondarily `cluster_drafting`
- this does not replace task scoring with occupation-level priors; it only lifts the pressure/compression path for task bundles that are already structurally routine-like

Current live direct-evidence rule:
- `direct_evidence_reliability` must exceed `0.20` before resolved task evidence changes task difficulty or task pressure
- the `task_first_resolved_evidence` baseline path is source-aware:
  - `live_task_evidence` promotes earlier than the generic threshold
  - `reviewed_task_estimate` promotes somewhat earlier than the generic threshold
  - `benchmark_task_label` is held to a stricter threshold and lower max baseline weight
- task mapping confidence damps task-first baseline promotion so weaker task-cluster mappings do not over-promote
- blend weight is capped at `0.85`
- when a task row promotes into the task-first baseline path, the remaining task-evidence blend weight is reduced by the portion already consumed by that baseline promotion
- when multiple promoted task-level sources exist for the same task, the runtime resolves a weighted task-level consensus using source reliability, `evidence_weight`, and source-role multipliers before blending
- the task-ease signal used for `automation_difficulty` is `0.65 * automation_score + 0.25 * exposure_score + 0.10 * augmentation_score`
- the direct-pressure task signal is `0.50 * automation_score + 0.35 * exposure_score + 0.15 * augmentation_score`
- task-level source precedence is `live_task_evidence` -> `reviewed_task_estimate` -> `benchmark_task_label` -> `cluster_prior_proxy` -> `fallback_task_proxy`
- `cluster_prior_proxy` and `fallback_task_proxy` remain fallback-only tiers in the blend logic; they identify unresolved tasks but do not themselves receive a positive task-evidence blend weight
- cluster priors still provide the fallback difficulty anchor in the current live engine, but clusters with strong enough resolved task coverage can now take a task-first baseline blend before task-row scoring and tasks with strong enough direct reliability can now take a task-first task baseline as well

Current live cluster and wave rule:
- `transformation_map`, `top_exposed_work`, and `wave_trajectory` now come from cluster summaries aggregated from the scored task rows
- those task-derived cluster summaries carry task-level difficulty, wave assignment, absorption rate, direct pressure, spillover, retained share, and retained leverage
- those cluster summaries also expose whether the underlying cluster baseline came from `cluster_priors` or `task_first_cluster_evidence`, plus the task-first blend weight, evidence coverage diagnostics, and task-first task counts
- the live engine now recomputes the public wave engine from the task-derived cluster bundle rather than preserving a separate pre-task wave bundle

Current live role-variant rule:
- a reviewed subset of occupations now exposes more than one stable default role shape in the browser scorer
- the browser recommends the closest reviewed variant from the current questionnaire profile plus the current task/function mix
- an explicit user variant choice overrides the recommendation until the user returns to auto mode
- once the baseline is chosen, the normal editable composition flow still has final authority because users can continue adding/removing tasks and functions and changing workflow links

## Current limitations

- Job-description evidence now covers all `34` modeled occupations.
- Multi-anchor function coverage exists only for a reviewed subset of occupations.
- The transformation output is still a first-pass model and still depends on role-family defaults, benchmark floors, and cluster-prior proxies under the reviewed overrides.
- Resolved task evidence now affects task-level pressure and task-level difficulty in the live browser scorer, and high-reliability tasks can now use a task-first task baseline, but low-coverage tasks still fall back to the cluster-seeded path.
- The live explanation layer is now generated from the current run, but it is still a compact summary rather than a full task/source drill-down surface.
- The live questionnaire layer now writes a native factor-based role-refinement profile in the app, but the engine still retains the legacy-answer fallback for compatibility with external callers and older tests.
- Reviewed role variants now exist only for a small heterogeneous subset of occupations, so most occupations still use a single default baseline bundle.
