# V2.0 Results Specification

## Scope

This is a supporting contract doc, not the main planning doc.

For current model status, roadmap, and next steps, read:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/role_transformation_overhaul_plan.md`

## Purpose

This document describes the current live `2.0` results contract as implemented in:
- `v2_engine.js`
- `app.js`
- `index.html`

Current live surfaces:
- `/` = model
- `/guide` = guide
- `/method` = methodology

## Current Public Result Order

The live page now renders results in this order:

1. role summary header
2. role fate headline with confidence
3. wave trajectory cards
4. structured narrative cards
5. `Role Fate Map`
6. task-level breakdown
7. recomposition summary
8. occupation assignment and evidence summary
9. labor-market context

The page still exposes wave trajectory as a secondary surface, but the primary public ontology is now `Role Fate`.

## Current Headline Surface

The live headline surface shows:
- `role_fate_label`
- `role_summary`
- `role_fate_confidence`
- top task under direct pressure
- primary displacement wave
- retained leverage tier
- personalization-fit tier
- occupation anchor

## Current Role Fate Map

The live `Role Fate Map` is rendered in the client from `task_breakdown.tasks`.

Current columns:
- `Current role`
- `Bargaining-power tasks`
- `Direct AI pressure`
- `Indirect spillover`
- `Retained leverage`

These columns are derived from task-level signals, not directly returned as a first-class `role_fate_map` object from the engine.

## Current Task-Evidence Behavior

The live engine is now hybrid rather than a pure cluster-only path:

1. a prior-based cluster baseline is still computed from cluster priors shrunk toward the occupation exposure prior
2. before task rows are scored, clusters with strong enough resolved task-evidence coverage can shift that baseline toward a task-first cluster evidence estimate
3. that resulting cluster baseline is projected onto active task rows as the fallback starting task-difficulty model
4. `task_source_evidence.csv` resolves each task's best available task-level evidence using source precedence
5. tasks with high enough task-level evidence reliability can now promote into a task-first task baseline before any residual task-evidence blending is applied
6. any remaining reliable resolved task evidence can still blend into task `automation_difficulty`
7. task-level direct pressure is then computed from that task-level difficulty
8. reliable resolved task evidence can also blend into the task's final `direct_exposure_pressure`

Current blend rule:
- resolved task evidence only affects task difficulty or task pressure when `direct_evidence_reliability > 0.20`
- the evidence blend weight is capped at `0.85`
- the cluster-baseline task-first path only activates when cluster-level task evidence clears the runtime coverage and reliability thresholds
- the task-baseline task-first path is source-aware:
  - `live_task_evidence` can promote earlier than the generic threshold
  - `reviewed_task_estimate` can promote somewhat earlier than the generic threshold
  - `benchmark_task_label` is held to a stricter threshold and lower max baseline weight
- task mapping confidence also damps the task-first baseline weight so ambiguous mappings do not over-promote
- the task-level source precedence is:
  - `live_task_evidence`
  - `reviewed_task_estimate`
  - `benchmark_task_label`
  - `cluster_prior_proxy`
  - `fallback_task_proxy`
- when more than one promoted task-level source is available, the runtime resolves a weighted task-level consensus using source reliability, `evidence_weight`, and source-role multipliers before applying the blend
- `cluster_prior_proxy` and `fallback_task_proxy` remain fallback metadata and do not themselves receive a task-evidence blend weight in the current runtime
- the task-ease signal used for `automation_difficulty` is:
  - `0.65 * automation_score`
  - `0.25 * exposure_score`
  - `0.10 * augmentation_score`
- the direct-pressure signal used for `direct_exposure_pressure` is:
  - `0.50 * automation_score`
  - `0.35 * exposure_score`
  - `0.15 * augmentation_score`

This means the live browser scorer is no longer purely Anthropic-or-cluster at the task layer. It now resolves multiple task-level evidence tiers, can promote them into both a coverage-aware task-first cluster baseline and a task-first task baseline, and then still falls back to cluster priors where task evidence is thin. It still is not a universal pure per-task prior model, because low-coverage tasks remain cluster-seeded.

## Current Cluster-Summary Behavior

The live engine now derives public cluster summaries from the scored task rows when `task_breakdown` is available.

Current flow:
1. score task rows
2. aggregate task rows back into task-derived cluster summaries
3. recompute public wave timing from that task-derived cluster bundle
4. use those summaries for:
   - `top_exposed_work`
   - `role_defining_work` retained-share updates
   - `transformation_map.current_bundle`
   - `transformation_map.exposed_clusters`
   - `transformation_map.retained_clusters`
   - `transformation_map.elevated_clusters`
   - `wave_trajectory`
   - `primary_displacement_wave`

This means the public cluster layer and public wave engine now reflect task-level difficulty blending, task-level direct-evidence pressure blending, and task-level spillover instead of relying only on the pre-task cluster bundle.

## Current Role-Variant Behavior

For a small reviewed subset of heterogeneous occupations, the live app now supports more than one reviewed baseline role shape.

Current flow:
1. `getRoleComposition(...)` can expose reviewed role variants for the selected occupation
2. the browser recommends the closest variant from the current questionnaire profile and current role mix
3. the user can keep that recommendation or explicitly override it
4. that selected variant changes the default task/function bundle the role studio starts from
5. after that, normal task/function editing still has final authority over the active composition used for scoring

This means the runtime is no longer always starting from one occupation-wide default bundle for every occupation.

For the stronger reviewed split occupations, the selected variant can now also change the starting function-anchor mix rather than only swapping tasks under one shared function baseline.

## Current Narrative Contract

The narrative panel now uses four structured cards:

1. `Likely Organizational Fate`
2. `Direct Pressure And Spillover`
3. `What Protects Bargaining Power`
4. `How Your Inputs Shift The Result`

These are powered by:
- `role_fate_readout.organizational_fate`
- `fate_drivers`
- `fate_counterweights`
- `narrative_summary`

`ClusterRow` in the current live result is now effectively a task-derived cluster summary with fields including:

```ts
type ClusterRow = {
  task_cluster_id: string
  label: string
  share_of_role: number
  automation_difficulty: number
  automation_difficulty_source: 'task_aggregated_cluster_model' | 'task_aggregated_resolved_task_evidence' | 'task_aggregated_task_first_resolved_evidence'
  baseline_difficulty_source: 'cluster_priors' | 'task_first_cluster_evidence'
  task_first_weight: number
  task_evidence_coverage_ratio: number
  task_evidence_mean_reliability: number
  resolved_task_evidence_count: number
  wave_assignment: 'current' | 'next' | 'distant'
  wave_assignment_source: 'task_aggregated'
  absorption_rate: number
  direct_exposure_pressure: number
  indirect_dependency_pressure: number
  retained_leverage: number
  evidence_confidence: number
  exposure_score: number
  exposure_level: 'low' | 'moderate' | 'high'
  exposed_share: number
  retained_share: number
  residual_relevance: number
  elevation_boost: number
  absorbed_share: number
  is_role_critical: boolean
  direct_evidence_task_count: number
  task_first_task_count: number
  task_evidence_adjusted_tasks: number
  summary_source: 'task_aggregated'
}
```

The editable composition payload that drives this result is now:

```ts
type CompositionEdits = {
  removed_task_ids: string[]
  added_task_ids: string[]
  removed_function_ids: string[]
  added_function_ids: string[]
  task_share_overrides: Record<string, number>
  task_function_links: Array<{
    task_id: string
    function_id: string
  }>
}

type DependencyEdits = {
  added_edges: Array<{
    from_task_id: string
    to_task_id: string
  }>
}
```

The live model page now usually produces this payload through `getRoleComposition(occupationId)` plus the role graph editor, not through the older five-selector task-input flow.

The engine also exposes an occupation-scoped composition baseline through `getRoleComposition(occupationId)`, with source-bucketed tasks plus function anchors for the editor.
That baseline now includes the reviewed task-to-function graph for both display and live scoring; custom task-to-function links are additive overrides rather than the only function links the scorer sees.

Current counter meaning:
- `task_breakdown.direct_evidence_tasks` now means active tasks resolved to a task-level evidence tier (`live_task_evidence`, `reviewed_task_estimate`, or `benchmark_task_label`), not only Anthropic-backed rows.
- `task_breakdown.cluster_fallback_tasks` means active tasks that still fall back to proxy-only resolution.

Current supporting counters:
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.task_evidence_adjusted_rows` = how many active task rows actually received a resolved-task-evidence blend
- `diagnostics.task_evidence_adjusted_tasks` = matching engine-level counter for the same runtime behavior
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.task_first_cluster_rows` = how many active cluster baselines promoted into the coverage-aware task-first path
- `diagnostics.task_first_cluster_count` = matching engine-level counter for that cluster-baseline behavior
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.task_first_task_rows` = how many active task rows promoted into the task-first task baseline path
- `diagnostics.task_first_task_count` = matching engine-level counter for that task-baseline behavior
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.live_task_evidence_rows` = how many active task rows resolved primarily to Anthropic live task evidence
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.reviewed_task_estimate_rows` = how many active task rows resolved primarily to reviewed task estimates
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.benchmark_task_label_rows` = how many active task rows resolved primarily to benchmark task labels
- `evidence_summary.source_coverage.cluster_proxy_rows` = how many active task rows still fall back to cluster proxy resolution

## Structural Scores Now Used Publicly

The live page relies on these engine-level structural scores:
- `direct_exposure_pressure`
- `indirect_dependency_pressure`
- `retained_leverage_score`
- `residual_role_integrity`
- `exposed_core_share`
- `retained_core_share`
- `demand_expansion_modifier`
- `function_retention`
- `function_exposure_pressure`
- `retained_function_strength`
- `retained_accountability_strength`
- `retained_bargaining_power`
- `delegation_likelihood`
- `headcount_displacement_risk`
- `augmentation_fit`
- `substitution_risk_modifier`

Public wording rule:
- keep `residual_role_integrity`
- do not expose `coherence` as the primary public label
- when wave cards still display wave connectivity, label it as `retained integrity`

Current metric note:
- `retained_bargaining_power` in the live engine now leans more on pressure-adjusted retained task leverage and less on raw task bargaining-weight averages alone
- routine-heavy or support-heavy work that is already under high pressure now drags this metric down more than it did in earlier builds
- `workflow_compression` and the routine-pressure path now also incorporate an adaptation-derived routine-context lift for structurally routine, low-people-intensity occupations, concentrated in execution/admin/documentation-heavy task bundles

## Current Gaps Between Spec And Implementation

Still not implemented as first-class result objects:
- a direct `role_fate_map` payload from the engine
- explicit `split_risk`, `collapse_risk`, or `elevation_potential` fields
- source drill-down at the task-row UI level
- weighted user-entered task shares
- universal per-task priors; the current live build now has both task-first cluster baselines and task-first task baselines, but low-coverage tasks still inherit a cluster-seeded fallback path

Still implemented as transitional compatibility surfaces:
- `role_outlook`
- `role_outlook_label`
- wave trajectory cards
- legacy transformation cluster lists
- legacy-answer questionnaire compatibility fallback

Current explanation surface:
- the engine now returns a live explanation summary generated from the current edited run
- the explanation block is now aligned to the same task/function graph and function metrics that drive the live score
- the client also surfaces task-to-function links and user-declared support links in the composition flow before scoring
- for supported occupations, the client also surfaces a reviewed role-variant selector ahead of the graph editor and shows whether the current baseline is recommended or manually overridden

## Current Acceptance Criteria

The current live result is considered aligned when:

1. the page shows current task makeup before the task breakdown verdict logic becomes abstract
2. direct AI pressure and indirect spillover are separate visible concepts
3. bargaining-power tasks are shown explicitly
4. role fate is a first-class label with confidence
5. task-level rows carry the main explanation burden
6. public copy does not rely on `coherence` as the main explanatory term

## Next Result-Surface Work

Recommended next changes:
- return `role_fate_map` directly from the engine rather than rebuilding it in the client
- add source drill-down and task-level citations
- add weighted task-share controls so users can do more than tag a handful of tasks
- add explicit before/after deltas for composition edits
- reduce or remove the legacy-answer compatibility fallback as external callers migrate
